# MordheimCOTDDBPatch
DB patch for Mordheim city of the damned

1) BACKUP your original database : if you do not, you'll have to reacquire it through steam "check game files integrity"

2) The jar file is executable
simply put it in the same directory as the database file, execute it, nothing happens, it worked.

The mordheim database is inside steam filesystem : mordheim/mordheim_data/StreamingAssets/database/mordheim (the file is the database)


DO NOT uses it twice : it adds and remove some rows, using it twice shouldn't do any harm to the DB (the file should just crash). But hey, who knows.
