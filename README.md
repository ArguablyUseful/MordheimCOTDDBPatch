# MordheimCOTDDBPatch
DB patch for Mordheim city of the damned

1) BACKUP your original database : if you do not, you'll have to reacquire it through steam "check game files integrity"

2) The jar file is executable
simply put it in the same directory as the database file, execute it, you'll have a wonderful UI with many features, such as a button, that you should click on and wait. Once it turns to "Done !" your DB is patched. If it turns to "Error !" then, guess what..there was an error and you should delete the mordheim file since it might have been corrupted.

The mordheim database is inside steam filesystem : mordheim/mordheim_data/StreamingAssets/database/mordheim (the file is the database)


DO NOT uses it twice : it adds and remove some rows, using it twice shouldn't do any harm to the DB (the file should just crash). But hey, who knows.

USES those files in MP at your own risks : there was no check as to wheter or not the game would work fine in MP with modified DB.
